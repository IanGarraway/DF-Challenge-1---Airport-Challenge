- [x] responds with the correct error code if abnormal data (letters) detected
- [x] responds with the correct error code if abnormal data (0 or less) detected
- [x] responds with the correct error code if null data detected

### <b><i>User Story 8</i></b>
<br>As a air traffic controller I would like to ensure there is capacity to manage the plane before I allow it to land so that I don't land planes we can't manage.
