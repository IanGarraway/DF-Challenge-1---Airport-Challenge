# Project Justification

With multiple members of staff, over multiple shifts controlling the flow of planes, it becomes increasingly more difficult to track the amount of planes presently at the airport and the amount of space presently available. Without a system tracking this it is possible for planes to be allowed to land when there is no space available to contain them.

The purpose of this software is to  assist in controlling the flow of planes at an airport. It will be able to inform Air Traffic controllers if there is space available at the airport so they can land a plane confident there will be capacity for it. It will be able to allow the Air traffic controllers to instruct a plane to take-off, confident that the plane is in the airport to take-off from. Circumstances can change on a day to day basis though, so the capacity of the airport will be adjustable to take into consideration unforeseen circumstances as well as for planned expansion.

To facilitate this:

The software will be able list and track the number of planes presently landed at the airport.

Air traffic controllers will be able to instruct planes to land at the airport if the airport is not full or if the plane is not already landed.

Air traffic controllers will be able to instruct planes to take off from the airport, if the plane is presently at the airport.

It will be possible to override the maximum capacity of the airport as appropriate.
